### Project Overview

### Data Sources

The dataset used in this project was sourced through Coursera and made available by Motivate International Inc from Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC. The data is subject to the following [License Agreement](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

The data is hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket named 'divvy-tripdata,' and the data files can be accessed through the following link: [divvy-tripdata Bucket](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

The bucket consists of bike trip data through different years and I selected data for the year 2022 for my analysis. 

This data is organized into 12 files, with each file corresponding to the trips that occurred in a specific month of the year. The files are named in a way that indicates the month covered (e.g., `202201-divvy-tripdata.zip` for January 2022, `202204-divvy-tripdata.zip` for April 2022, etc).

The provided links lead to the index of the 'divvy-tripdata' bucket, where you can explore and download the individual data files. Please adhere to the [Data License Agreement](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) when using the dataset.
